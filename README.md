# **Summary:**

More info: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/GreeFoxTheDev/Daggers/wiki) and [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/tXJcWx92HM)

This plugin adds new craftable weapons called 'Daggers'. Daggers are small, fast-recharging weapons (high attack speed), with small amount of damage. Crafting recipes are shapelles, which means that you can put items where you like and it'll still make the dagger.

## **Compatibility:**

It's fully compatible with almost any plugin for it's simplicity. The main problem can be texturepacks, because if one is overwritten by other, it doesn't understand that texturepack 'under' is actually using the custom model data, I'll try to cover all the problems and how to solve them below. Plugins that **PERFECTLY** fit to this:
 - [**Katanas**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/katanas/)
 - [**Copper Items**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/copper-items)

## **Texturepack:**

 - [**Texturepack**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/my-plugins-resource-pack)
 - if you are using another plugin that needs texturepack, merge mine and different texturepack together

### **Installation guide:**

 - Get the .jar file in 'plugins' folder
 - You're done!
